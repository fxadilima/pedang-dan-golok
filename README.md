# ⚔ The Sword and The Saber

This project aims to break down Jin Yong's original story, Yitian Tulong Ji (倚天屠龍記), also known as The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber, into several distinct, self-contained serialized stories. We've divided it as follows:

---

## Book 1

This book serves as the introduction to the story. It begins with Guo Xiang's journey after the meeting at Mount Hua, concluding with her farewell to Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü. Guo Xiang is depicted as reuniting with Zhang Junbao—who eventually becomes the legendary figure, Zhang Sanfeng.

---

## Book 2

The second part commences when a twenty-year-old Zhang Wuji emerges from his hideout and begins to explore the martial arts world. This section concludes after the battle at Shaolin and after Yin Li departs, leaving the trio (Zhang Wuji, Zhao Min, and Zhou Zhiruo).

---

## Book 3

The third part continues the Yitian Tulong Ji narrative from the point after Yin Li's departure, concluding with the fall of the Yuan Dynasty.

---

## Book 4

The final part of this story begins in the early era of the Ming Dynasty, founded by Zhu Yuanzhang.

This re-telling of the story in **Book 1** ultimately became the inspiration for Jin Yong when he narrated the secret inner force technique that healed Zhang Wuji, namely **Jiu Yang Shen Gong**.

However, in our story, a short story about a Goryeo descendant girl named Ki Son-yeo becomes the main character. While she won't be deeply explored after the introduction, she will reappear repeatedly, especially in Book 2 and Book 3. In Book 4, Ki Son-yeo (or Qi Shengniang) will be older but will secretly remain active as an advisor to all those she loves.
